Digital images, serving as the primary carrier of information, have been wildly spread on the Internet. Image steganography is a technology that employs images as the carrier for information hiding. While current deep image steganography demonstrated impressive encoding abilities across various media, two serious problems have been overlooked in deep image-to-image steganography and hinder its application under real-world scenarios, which we define as the problem of Pixel Value Overflow and Gap of Precision. In this paper, we explore the cause of those problems and introduce a plug-and-play Universal Suppressor to solve the application problems of deep image-to-image steganography in real-world scenarios, which can be flexibly applied to various models with different structures. Experiments demonstrate that our Universal Suppressor performs well in existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) models and confers them with intrinsic robustness for real-world deployment.

# Devil in the Stego Image

Almost all current image-to-image steganographic models overlook a subtle but significant problem in real-world applications: the representation of stego images. In everyday communication, images are typically stored in PNG or JPG formats, with pixel values represented using 8-bit precision, constrained within an integer range of [0, 255]. However, nearly all existing deep learning-based image steganography fails to impose restrictions on the interval and precision of pixel value representations in stego images. In practical scenarios, the stego image must satisfy two key constraints:


- **Interval**: The interval of the pixel value should fall within the interval [0, 255]. Pixel values that exceed this range must be truncated. We refer to this issue as the Pixel Value Overflow (PVO).
- **Precision**: Deep learning frameworks commonly use 32-bit floating-point numbers, which offer greater numerical precision than an 8-bit representation of the image. Consequently, the stego image generated by the encoder must be rounded, giving rise to what we call the Gap of Precision (GOP).


However, while these issues do not compromise the visual quality of the stego image, they induce immeasurable degradation in the recovered image. As illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:prob1}, the upper panel demonstrates that stego images generated by the model contain numerous invalid pixel values, such as 257, -3, 260 (out of interval [0,255]), and 2.3 (out of 8-bit precision). Although direct decoding of such unmodified stego images yields visually acceptable reconstructions, in the real-world scenario, the stego image will be transmitted through the Internet, and the invalid pixel values will be truncated and quantized before transmission. As shown in the lower panel of Figure \ref{fig:prob1}, in the realistic condition, the invalid pixel values of the stego image will be truncated (257 → 255, -3 → 0, 260 → 255) and quantized (2.3 → 2), resulting in irreversible information loss. Consequently, the decoder fails to reconstruct the original secret image, producing outputs that contain substantial noise interference and display structural artifacts that severely compromise visual fidelity.


# How to use USP?
What you only need to do is to **insert the USP between the encoder and decoder and train it as usual**. During the training phase, the USP processes the stego image generated by encoder through its suppression-quantization pipeline before delivering the normalized output to the decoder, conditioning the model to inherently compensate for distortions of real-world scenarios.
